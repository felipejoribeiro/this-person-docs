# Flask and data bases
Databases organize data and a program can access then via query when needed. There are the `relational` database and the `No relational` database, known respectively as `SQL` and `NoSQL` databases that differs in the query language they use.

## SQL databases
These databases stores data in tables, which model the different entities in the application's domain. That is, for a management table, probably there will have definitions for users, orders and products tables. This `table` has a fixed number of columns and many rows as necessary. So a costumers table will have information about the costumers, like name, email and password hash. Each row is a data nuget that is what the table is about.

These tables have a special column named `primary key`, which stores a unique identifier for each row stored in the table. They can also have columns called `foreign keys` which reference the primary key of a row in the same o other table. These links between tables are called `relationships` and are the foundation of relational databases.

Check this example:


```
     ._________.      .___________.
     |  roles  |      |   users   | 
     |_________|      |___________|
     | id      |-|-+  | id        |
     | name    |   |  | username  |
     |         |   |  | password  |
     |         |   +-<| role_id   |
     .---------.      .-----------.

```

This graphical style is called `entity-relationship diagram`. It lists the columns of the databases and express its foreign relations. The `-|` sign in the arrow indicates that only one element from the roles table is involved in this relationship. And the `-<` sign signifies that multiple elements from the `users` table can have this reference. If the relation were one for one, then both would be `-|`, for example.

## NoSQL databases
These are databases that do not follow the relational model described before. A common organization method used instead is the `collections` and `documents` model, that replaces tables by the former and records by the latter. This design patter make joins difficult, so most of then do not support this operation. So this operation must be done in the application itself, by takin the `role_id` in one table and making a new `query` in the other (assuming a situation like the last example).
A common countermeasure is to use just one database and have duplicate information, but avoid multiple related tables.

## Comparing these two types
The principal difference between these two is that the `SQL` database follows the `ACID` paradigm that implies Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability, which makes the database extremely reliable. But that comes with a performance cost. But for medium size applications both are very performant and capable.

## Databases and python
Python has libraries to deal with all sorts of databases, opensource or commercial. Flasks puts no restrictions on what database packages can be used, so you can chose at will.

There are also a number of database abstraction layer packages, such as `SQLAlchemy` or `MongoEngine`. That allows the developer to work with higher level with regular python objects instead of database entities such as tables, documents and query languages.

There is a number of things to evaluate when choosing a database framework:
- *Ease of use*: When comparing straight database engines and database abstractions, the second group wins. These abstractions are called `object-relational mappers` (ORMs) or `object-document mappers` (ODMs). They convert high level object-oriented operations to low level database instructions.

- *Performance*: There is an overhang when using `ORMs` and `ODMs`, but in most cases that is negligible, and the gains in productivity make it justifiable. The best thing is to chose an abstraction layer that supports access to the underlying database in case specific operations. So when the performance impact is measurable then you can ponder about use the direct instructions.

- *Portability*: You must pay attention on what database frameworks are available in the plataforms you are headed to deploy your application. Choosing the most popular is a safe move.

- *Flask integration*: Choosing a database that integrates well with flask is advised too. This is good to avoid the developers to write integration directives thenselves. So checking the availability of packages is a good practice.

## Flask-SQLAlchemy
The `Flask-SQLAlchemy` ia a flask extension that simplifies the use of `SQLAlchemy` inside the application. You can install teh package with pip:

```bash
pip install flask-sqlalchemy
```

The database is specified as a `URL`. Here are some examples of declaring the database:

|Database engine|URL|
|-|-
|MySQL|mysql://username:password@hostname/database|
|Postgres|postgresql://username:password@hostname/database|
|SQLite (Linux, macOS) |sqlite:////absolute/path/to/database|
|SQLite (Windows)|sqlite:///c:/absolute/path/to/database|

In the `URL` you must specify the `hostname` that refers to the server where the database is hosted (this could be `localhost`, for example). There is the name of the database too in the url. For databases that require authentication you must send the `username` and `password` as well.

This `URL` must be configured as the key `SALALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI` in the flask configuration object. The lib documentation also suggests setting the key `SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS` to `false` to use less memory, unless signals for object changes are needed. There are more configuration options in the documentation.

```python
import os
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

basedir = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__))

app = Flask(__name__)

app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] =\
    'sqlite:///' + os.path.join(basedir, 'data.sqlite')

app.config['SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS'] = False

db = SQLAlchemy(app)

```

The db object instantiated from the class SQLAlchemy represents the database and provides access to all the functionality of Flask-SQLAlchemy.

## Model definition
`Model` is the persistent entities used by the application. In the context of `ORM`, a model is typically a Python class with attributes that match the columns of a corresponding database table.

`Flask-SQLAlchemy` provides a base class with methods and other helper classes that are used to define the data structure.
The `users` and `roles` example could be defined as follows:

```python
class Role(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = 'roles'
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String(64), unique=True)
    def __repr__(self):
        return '<Role %r>' % self.name

class User(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = 'users'
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    username = db.Column(db.String(64), unique=True, index=True)
    def __repr__(self):
        return '<User %r>' % self.username
```

It's always good to name your tables as the default name don't follow good conventions.

The first argument in the `db.Column()` method is th type of the database column and model attribute. Here goes the available ones:

|Type name|Python type|Description
|-|-|-
|Integer|int|Regular integer, typically 32 bits
|SmallInteger|int|Short-range integer, typically 16 bits
|BigInteger|int or long|Unlimited precision integer
|Float|float|Floating-point number
|Numeric|decimal.Decimal|Fixed-point number
|String|str|Variable-length string
|Text|str|Variable-length string, optimized for large or unbounded length
|Unicode|unicode|Variable-length Unicode string
|UnicodeText|unicode|Variable-length Unicode string, optimized for large or unbounded length
|Boolean|bool|Boolean value
|Date|datetime.date|Date value
|Time|datetime.time|Time value
|DateTime|datetime.datetime|Date and time value
|Interval|datetime.timedelta Time| interval
|Enum|str|List of string values
|PickleType|Any Python object|Automatic Pickle serialization
|LargeBinary|str|Binary blob

The remaining arguments specify configuration options for each attribute:

|Option name|Description|
|-|-|
|primary_key|If set to True, the column is the tableâ€™s primary key.|
|unique|If set to True, do not allow duplicate values for this column.|
|index|If set to True, create an index for this column, so that queries are more efficient.
|nullable|If set to True, allow empty values for this column. If set to False, the column will not allow null values.|
|default|Define a default value for the column.|

Flask requires that all models have defined a primary key column. It's commonly named id. Notice that both models include a `__repr__()` method to give them a readable string representation that can be used for debugging and testing purposes.

## Relationships
Relationships can be implemented here as well. Here we can use the example of the `users` and `roles` again. Check how it would be implemented in flask_sqlalchemy:

```python
class Role(db.Model):
    # ...
    users = db.relationship('User', backref='role')

class User(db.Model):
    # ...
    role_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('roles.id'))
```
Here, the `role_id` column is added to the `User` table as a `foreign key`. The `roles.id` argument in `db.ForeignKey()` specifies that the column should be interpreted as having id values from rows in the roles table. The `users` attribute added to the `Role` model represents the object-oriented view of the relationship. Given an instance of the `Role` class, the users attribute will return the list of users associated with that role (so, the other way around).

Some times the `db.relationship()` can locate the relationship's foreign key on its own, but sometimes it cannot. There are configuration options to this function as well:

|Option name|Description|
|-|-|
|backref|Add a back reference in the other model in the relationship.|
|primaryjoin|Specify the join condition between the two models explicitly. This is necessary only for ambiguous relationships.
|lazy|Specify how the related items are to be loaded. Possible values are select (items are loaded on demand the first time they are accessed), immediate (items are loaded when the source object is loaded), joined (items are loaded immediately, but as a join), subquery (items are loaded immediately, but as a subquery), noload (items are never loaded), and dynamic (instead of loading the items, the query that can load them is given).
|uselist|If set to False, use a scalar instead of a list.|
|order_by|Specify the ordering used for the items in the relationship.|
|secondary|Specify the name of the association table to use in many-to-many relationships.|
|secondaryjoin|Specify the secondary join condition for many-to-many relationships when SQLAlchemy cannot determine it on its own.|

There are other types other relationships besides `one-to-many` as this one. One example is the `one-to-one` relationship, and it can be implemented using `one` in the place of `many` in the previous example. There is an aditional type, more complex, called `many-to-many` that needs a third table to describe the relations. It will be better discussed ahead.

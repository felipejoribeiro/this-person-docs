# Learning principles of information security
You don't need to learn all programming languages to know how to deal with programming. This is due to the fact that all programming languages obey to three fundamental principles:

- The principle of abstraction;
- The principle of correspondence;
- The principle of Data type completeness.

As described by `R. D. Tennet`. Then, when you are able to understand that every programming language is a implementation of these needs, you can adapt your workflow to any syntax or paradigm. There will be a plenty of times when you will be lost and will not know what to do. But that is fine. Part of the job is the constant discovery and research. And with each problem you will be better at discovering solutions. So the most important thing isn't to know, but to know how to discover.

The field is very vast, so there are two approaches. You can chose one field and become an expert or you can become a generalist. But in both cases you must understand how to engage new things, as they always keep comming aside your professional inclinations.

A common question is "When is a penetration tester good enough?"

The first thing we must understand is how to thing outside the box. A good way of exercising non standard thinking is by always focusing on the limitations of the problem. That is, instead of thinking on what you can do, you must first list all the things you can't do and truly imagine ways of always broad your channel of possibilities.

A tendency when dealing with a problem is to repeat the practices that you observed around you throughout your life. Thinking outside the box means to being able to look through this noise. And really test all limitations and obstacles imposed on us by our natural bias. A good phrase is:

"A problem is an emotional state. Without emotions, it is just a situation."

Confusion and frustration are what define that there is a problem. Without those, you are just working and learning, as always. There is nothing to fear, what must be done will eventually be done and what must occur will eventually occur.

Other thing that is very important, is that you must know your goal. When you don't have a clear goal, you will stop on the first obstacle, that can take the form of another problem vaguely associated with what you are doing, but you end up investing several hours on this side topic and completely forgeting what you was doing in the first place. Estipulate a clear goal is essential. Goals are what keep us moving, find one for your self in everything you do.

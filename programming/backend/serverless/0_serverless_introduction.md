# The Serverless computation, an introduction
The serverless computational paradigm is a execution model where the logic in the serverside is stateless, only functioning with triggers. The definition is associated with "Functions as a service"(FaaS), which means that we want to focus on the in the implementation and not in how it will be deployed or executed by the server, with containers that are managed by a thirdparty.

A "serverless" service isn't really executed without a server. In reality the management of these servers is done as a service. In this context, the application is developed in a way that makes this feasible.

The benefits are scalability and affordability. The computational weight managing is done by the hosting provider.

To exemplify this structure we will see a

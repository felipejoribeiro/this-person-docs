# You can spawn some targets. About then:

- Docker Target: For a Kocker target, the instance will take the form of `http://<ip>:port>`. Here is an example: "http://157.245.40.149:30655".

- VM target: Mudules that have a windows target, active Directory (AD) environment. If the target needs credentials, you will be provided with credentials to authenticate via ssh, WinRM, RDP, etc. But there will be times that you will have to attack without keys. You can download the VPN key to interact with target VMS from your computer.

# Communication is everything ⭐️

Communication is the most important thing when managing virtual teams.
- Number 1 reason why managers fail at managing their virtual teams is ineffective communication;
  - Simply put, ineffective communication is the false assumption that what is being communicated to your virtual team is being 100% understood by your team (when in fact, it's mostly misunderstood or misconstrued);
  - Ineffective communication is the absolute core reason why the team as
    a whole ends up not executing according to plan or being proactively
    engaged in getting a project done.
- What bad communication leads:
  - a huge waste of time;
  - confusion among the team;
  - long and useless meetings;
  - endless back and forth emails;
  - team members that are not accountable or responsible;
  - a high degree of frustration;
- effective communication is a skill. CEOs and presidents sometimes struggle with the best way to communicate; Doing this with virtual teams is even more difficult as the body language is missing;
- Common issues faced in virtual teams:
  - trust issues;
  - cultural differences;
  - time zone differences;
  - accountability issues;
  - technology challenges;
  - lack of face-to-face interaction; 
All then can be solved with good communication.
- Knowing why and how to communicate is crucial.

## Summary of actions to this module:
- Understand that communication is everything in virtual teams;
- Observe how you currently communicate with your team and think about
  ways of improvement;
- To increase intimacy and cohesion, move up in the pyramid of tools and
  increase the variety of tools for communication;
- Remember about the curse of knowledge and explain things thoughtfully;
  - simplify the message;
  - put yourself in the other's shoes;
  - acknowledge that the curse exists;
- Observe how you typically respond to questions, make then all be “good” always.
  - Convince your team members to stop with the ugly and bad responses as well.
  - Good responses: the answer, yes, no, I don't know.

## Pyramid of communication
The team proximity spectrum:
- a team's composition can be seen as a point in a spectrum, with 100% virtual and 100% co-located team on the other hand:


           *--------------------------------------------*
          100%                                         100%
     virtual team                                 co-located team

Changing the composition of your team to the right decreases the challenges; To being able to do that we should check the pyramid of communication. We have different technologies to communicate with virtual teams; The higher the tool is in the pyramid the more it promotes cohesion and intimancy.

- Face to face;
- Telepresence; (high devinition and life-size projections)
- Video conferencing; (audio and video)
- Phone/teleconferencing; (audio only)
- Instant messaging/social media;
- Email;

Moving up this pyramid will incriase intimancy and cohesion in your team;

## The curse of knowledge
The curse of knowledge is the idea that “individuals fail to ignore information they possess that others do not when predicting others behavior”. It's the biggest reason why you think you are communicating properly with someone when in reality you are not. This can be analysed in the tappers and listeners study which was conducted by elizabeth newton, a Ph.D. graduate student in psychology at Stanford University (1990).

- In the study there was two groupes, there were the tappers and the listeners.
- They gave the tappers a list of well-known songs (such as happy birthday to you);
- each tapper had to pick a song and tap out the rhythm to a listener by knocking on a table.
- They asked the listeners to guess the song by listening the taps.
- Furthermore, they asked the tappers to predict the odds that listeners would guess correctly. They assumed 50%.
- However, the real number was 2.5%.
- This was shocking to the tappers (the common response was something like “isn't the song obvious? How can they be so stupid”)

The reason this happened was that when the tappers were tapping, they were hearing the songs in their head. It was extremely hard for the tappers to imagine what it's like to lack that knowledge. This is the curse of knowledge. The knowledge affected the tapper's capacity of comunication. It happens throughout our society. It's a hard problem to avoid.

To avoid the curse of knowledge:
- The first step is to acknowledge that the curse exists in every single mean of communication because it's a problem with the information emitter, the medium doesn't matter.
- The second step is to train your empathy. Always put yourself in the other person's shoes (think about their experience, background, and culture) and how they might be viewing your communication. Remember when the portuguese came to brazil, the indigenous people didn't recognize the ships until people started coming out of it.
- The third is to simplify the message. “Explain this to me like I'm a 12 years old”.

## The 3 responses to questions
There are only three types of responses to any questions: The good, the bad and the ugly.

- The good: The good is when someone answers the question first, and then gives any additional information afterwards. It reduces ambiguity and doesn't waste anyone's time. Same way that the germans communicated through telegraph, as it wasn't a very reliable mean of communication.
- The bad: It stars with the sopporting information and then, after that, gives the response. It isn't efficient. It creates confusion and hurts the communication flow and ends up wasting a lot of time (that additional information might not be needed). Some indifiduals rely on this method to “soft the blow” of an answer, and for this, it's justifiable. However, using this as a default method should be avoided.
- The ugly: It doesn't respond the question. It's only a dump of supporting information that doesn't respond the question itself. It's the worst type of response, as no one gets an actual answer but everybody things they got it which causes confusion. Sometimes this occurs unintentionally, when the person responding things he delivered a response, when in fact the curse of knowledge made a strike. Other times its intentional, for example when politicians or public figures are avoiding answering a question, so they give convoluted side information dumps as an excuse for not answering it.

To answer all questions using the 'good' way of doing it, these four ways:
- The actual answer ('x is y, x has y, etc…');
- Yes;
- No;
- I don't know / I'm not sure; (when giving this type of answer, its good to follow up with your opinion, what your thoughs are about the subject, but with the disclosure that it's your opinion);

Good answers will make you an authority and will inspire confidence in your team; If a lot of people use the bad and the ugly, it's good to convince then to change their behavior.

# Principles of behavior change ⭐️
The principles of behavior change is about simple tactics that will make you influence your team to get things done. There are 4 power principles of behavior change that every person responds to — regardless of background, experience, culture, age, or gender. Applying one or more of those 4 principles is going to get you immediate results (there is no faster return on investment in terms of making your team get things done)

The four power principles:
- The Power of deadlines;
- The Power of assigning responsibility;
- The Power of specific tasks;
- The Power of writing;

Things to know about these principles:
- Each principle is backed up by specific research studies that explain the underlying reason behind why they work;
- Although the principles might sound simplistic, they are extremely powerful, so take then very seriously.
- The principles are independend from each other. You can start from a specific one without order.

## Summary of actions to this module:
- Always assign deadlines (with clear-cut dates for delivery, no ambiguity in objective);
  - avoid the **Parkinson's law**;
  - get feedback frequently (optimistic, pessimistic);
  - don't ever create too long deadlines;
- Avoid the **bystander effect** by always assigning tasks to individuals.
  - Use direct language;
  - Ask for volunteers;
  - Assign to individuals, always, even in group tasks;
- Always give specific tasks;
  - Know what you want before asking something to someone;
  - Be direct and precise with your words to transmit exactly what you want.
  - Always write your tasks down. Write then live and write then everywhere everytime.
- Write text live and write these tasks everywhere.

## The power of deadlines
We are all lazy. Most human beings are enherently lazy — we have an instinctive tendency to procrastinate with tasks that don't have a sense of urgency associated with them. We typically delay working on stuff whenever we get the chance. And we usually come up with false alibis such as waiting until we're in a better mood or waiting for more information.

There are plenty of psychological reasons for procrastinating, but one bug reason behind why we take a lot of time to finish a task is the Parkinson's law:

                  "Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion"

So if a task would typically take 1 hour to complete, then if you assign a 3-hour deadline to it, it will take up the full 3 hours to get done. So a task that doesn't have a deadline will never get done. And it applies both to self-imposed tasks and assigned tasks.

Deadlines provide:
- The developing of a sense of urgency;
- Accountability to the team members;
- A sense of encouragement;
- Help in prioritie determinagion;
- Sense of accomplishment;
- Force teams to get things done;

Three rules for setting deadlines:
- be reasonable: Set deadlines with a good notion about the work that will be performed, don't alocate too little time for a task, because if it isn't reasonable the person you are assigning it to will notice, and it will have the contrary effect; Always work with feedback for that; A good way if by asking for “optimistic”, “pessimistic” and “most likely” scenarios.
- Be clear-cut: Be 100% clear-cut about when the actual deadline is (day, date, and time) (no space for ambiguity);
- always use deadlines: What doesn't have deadlines will not be completed. It's even okay if it's a fake deadline. Leave it always lurking in the backlog to let your team know it's important and one day will have to be done. (if a deadline is too far off, create intermediate deadlines for checkpoints. Big deadlines has the same effect as no deadline);

## The power of assigning responsability
The case of kitty genoveses: she was a young woman who was stabbed to death in New York City in 1964. Over the course of half an hour, she was attacked three times on the street as neighbors watched from their windows. There were 38 witnesses but no one called the police during the attack. The case caused a huge outcry in the community and prompted psychologists to study the behavior. They conducted one study were a something bad happened. When the subject being examined though that he was the only one seeing, he got to help in 85% of the times, wile if he tough that there was more people watching he would go help in only 31% of times.

This is called the **bystander effect**, it says that, the bigger the number of bystanders in an emergency, the less likely it is that any one of them will help. It is closely realted to the **diffusion of responsibility** concept where people less likely will take responsibility where there are more people present.

        "everyone responsibility is no one responsibility"

How it applies in virtual teams:
- if people are not willing to take action to help someone who is dying due to bystander effect, then they will probably not take responsibility for assigned tasks in groups.
- In virtual teams, this effect is increased due to the lack of face-to-face interaction.

To avoid the effect:
- Use direct language: Let people know exactly who is responsible for each task at hand by the team. Avoid ambiguity;
- Ask for volunteers: It has two advantages. It increases the chances for the task to being done because a concept called **internal consistency**, which makes self assigned tasks more likely to be completed and let people chose what they have want to work on; If no one volunteers then you step up and asign someone. All tasks should have a responsible personel;
- Asign individuals and not groups: Always assign tasks to individual people and never to groups. Even if there are more individuals doing said task. One person should be chosed to be the "reporter" of said endeavour.


## The power of specific tasks
Virtual teams have difficults understanding social cues, such as gestures, facial expressions, and tone of voice. You have to be precise and direct with them, be very specific about your expectations, and avoid sarcasm and nonverbal communication.

Two rules for assigning specific tasks:
- Know what you want: Nine times out of ten people don't know what they want, and they really are in brainstorm mode. (but they think they know what they want). So before asking something from someone, first, finish the brainstorm phase, or be explicity that what you are proposing is a suggestion, and what are the options.
- Be direct: You must get to the point as fast as possible. You must say what you want using the right words. Don't leave space open to interpretation or assumptions.


## The power of writing
In an old hidden camera tv show, producers placed a fake sign on the highway between pennsylvania and delaware that read "delaware closed". Some drivers ignored the sign, but others stopped and believed it. One concerned driver even asked "when will it be opened? My family lives there".

- Written words have immense power due to the **"deference to authority"** principle. They carry a much higher authoritative message than verbal ones.
- Writting tasks down dramatically increases the probability that they will get done; This will also help people remember them better (as opposed to verballly assigned taks);

Rules for writting tasks down:
- write tasks live: Given the chance, the best way to get commitment from someone is to write out the tasks “live”, during a conference call; The participants can see you registering the task; Even if they can't see you if they can hear you typing has already good effect;
- write tasks everywhere and everytime: Never rely on verbal task requests, even minor ones. These tasks should be written everywhere where your team most spend time looking at. (meeting notes, spreadsheets, follow-up emails, eletronic whiteboards).

# Tactics of influence and persuasion ⭐️

The tactics of influence a persuasion is about methods to influence your team members to do what you need them to do. Unlike the previous module about principles of behavior change, which included a set of 4 principles that worked together, this module is about a fragmented list of strategies and tactics that you can use depending on the situation you're in.

## Summary of actions to this module:
- use one or more of Cialdini's 6 principles of influence to persuade your virtual team to get things done: Reciprocation, commitment to consistency, social proof, authority, liking, and scarcity.
- Increase the compliance rate of assigned tasks in your virtual team by using the word “because” in every meeting, email, IM, and voice message. It is best to include a well-thought-out reason after the word, even though a solid justification is not really needed;
- Use the 6 steps process to ensure 100% commitment by your team on really important tasks: Get then to say it, get a time frame, develop an obligation, stress importance, confirm action, show appreciation;
- To find out what someone is really thinking, isolate them and then ask them one of the following four questions: what would it take for you to love this idea? How do you think i can make this better? What would it take for you to be really excited about this? What would you do differently?


## Cialdini's 6 principles of influence
Thes is based on the book "Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion".

There are 6 rules described in this book:
- **Reciprocation**: Individuals have a tendency to return a favor; If you give someone somehthing of value, they are more likely to give you something back in the future;
  - examples:
    - help a team member with something that's not typically part of your responsibility;
    - send someone a token of appreciation as gift (e.g., employee gift-giving programs);
- **Commitment and consistency**: Individuals have a deep desire to be consistent. People will behave consistently with decisions and choices that they have already made (even if the original incentives of the decidion have been removed);
  - examples:
    - ask a team member to do a small request (with a high probability of acceptance) before asking for a bigger related task down the line;
    - Ask for volunteers to complete a task instead of assigning it to them. (The volunteer will aim to stay consistent with their choice)
- **Social Proof**: Individuals tend to do what other people are doing; People pursue the "safety in numbers" among other individuals, particularly when unsure about a decision;
  - examples:
    - A person is more likely to put money in a tip jar if he sees that other people ahead of him have already put in a tip;
    - Get buy-in on important decisions separately from team members before discussing them openly in a group;
    - Reference best practices that are published by well-known standards and frameworks (e.g., PMBOK, ITIL) as social proof to push back on any ineffective processes.
- **Authority**: Individuals tend to obey someone with a higher degree of authority; people get persuaded by individuals in positions of authority, such as uniformed personnel ("if an expert says it, it must be true");
  - example:
    - The *milgram experiment* at *Stanford University*, showed that subjects were willing to give painful electric shocks to another person because they were instructed to do so by an individual with an authoritative role.
    - Borrow authority from your own superior (or from the team members' respective superiors) to stress the importance of certain tasks;
    - Set expectations within the team that you are ultimately accountable for the success of a project (assigned authority);
- **liking**: Individuals tend to be influenced by people that they like; people will more likely buy somehting from someone who is similar to them;
  - example:
    - Get to know your team members personally — their likes/dislikes, families, hobbies, etc. — through informal discussions;
    - Focus on discussing any common similarities between you and them whenever you get the chance (background, parental status, culture, favorite sport teams, etc.);
    - Share articles, videos, or events that you think your team members might be interested in;
- **Scarcity**: Individuals tend to want things more when their availability is limited; People will demand more of something when it is scarce in supply;
  - example:
    - limited-time offers in car dealerships or special offers on clearance items in stores result in an increase in sales because of the scarcity principle;
    - Use terms such as “unique opportunity” or "once in a lifetime event" to entice team members into working on tasks that are highly-visible;
    - Stress time constraints and deadlines as a way to highlight time scarcity as a factor;

## The influential power of one word
In 1978, Ellen Langer of Harvard University, co-authored a social psychology paper about how people react to placebic information; She conducted an experiment to understand how people who were waiting in line to make photocopies on a xerox sho were waiting in line to make photocopies on a xerox machine would react when someone cut in front of them; The experiment is commonly referred to as the *Xerox study*;
The following three questons were used to see how people waiting in line would react:
- Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the Xerox machine, because I'm in a ruch?
- Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the Xerox machine?
- Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the Xerox machine, because I have to make copies? (fake justification)

The first request got a 94% of conversion rate.
The second request got a 60% of conversion rate.
The third request got a 93% of conversion rate.

Which is interesting as the third request didn't have a valid justification, but it got almost the same conversion as the first with a valid excuse.

The thing ta causes that is the **because** word, It is very powerfull. It is highly influential because it triggers an automatic compliance response, regardless of what is the justification. The study showed that using the word "because" incriased in 33% the compliance rate of any request; This is probably due to the fact that we are hard-wired by our relative and teachers as children to accept the reasoning that comes after the “because” no matter what.

The main takeway:

        use the word "because" everywhere to increase influence


## 6 steps to ensure 100% commitment
For high stakes tasks and projects, you can use a methodical step-by-step process that ensures 100% commitment by the person who is assigned to the task; This 6-step process builds on teh previous principles of behavior and persuasion;

Disclaimer: Use the process sparingly — overusing it could backfire, and team members might become immune to it.

Here are teh 6 steps:
- ask:
  - **Get them to say it**: After you assign a task to someone, try to get them to say the task or repeat it back to you; Have then saying the words increase commitiment;
    - example: At the end of the meeting say something like: "Just to make sure, I'd like to go around the table and confirm what everyone is going to be working on next";
  - **Get a time frame**: If you already assigned a deadline to the task, then ask teh person to repeat or confirm that as well; If you have not assigned a deadline to the task, then ask how long it would take (you should always have a deadline);
    - example: "Great, when will we be able to get that done?"
  - **Develop an obligation**: Develop a sense of obligation, to let the person know that because of their help, you will be altering your original plans; The idea is to let the person understand that a withdrawl of their commitment will result in some sort of disturbance for you, or someone else;
    - example: "Ok then, I'll move my other scheduled appointments to make sure i'm free on that day to discuss the draft…"
  - **Stress importance**: Develop a sense of conscience to let the person know that you're now dependent on them to get the task done. You want to stress the importance of the task as well as the negative consequences that might occur if it doesn't get done;
    - example: "Just as a side note, I will get reprimanded publicly if this isn't done by tuesday, so it's really important.";
- chose:
  - **Confirm action**: Close the request by confirming that the action will be carried out. End the meeting or conversation using a solid and concise verbal confirmation phrase;
    - example: "So I'll devinitely be getting a copy of this on friday, right?"
- the follow-up:
  - **Show appreciation**: After you make the request and sometime before the due date of the task approaches, follow-up with the person by expressing appreciation; Let the person know how much you value their efforts of following through on a task and that they're the kind of person who gets the job done;
    - example: "Sarah, I really appreciate your help on this task — I know I can count on you to get it finished on time";


## How to know what they're really thinking
It is very challenging to know exactly what someone's thoughts are about a task, a project, or a deliverable; asking a question like "what do you really think about htis?" would not necessarily give you a thruthful answer (because of human nature and/or politics); 

There is a two steps process that never fails to let you know exactly what someone is really thinking:
- **Isolate them**: the best way to make someone comfortable about speaking freely is to isolate them from the rest of the team; It reduces political repercutions of the given feedback; Schedule a separate one-on-one call or meeting with the person to discuss the topic;
- **Ask them one of four questions**:
  - **What would it take for you to love this idea?**;
  - **How do you think I can make this better?**;
  - **What would it take for you to be really excited about this?**;
  - **What would you do differently?**;

All four of these questions do a couple of things:
- They assume the person likes the idea, which makes them more confortable to criticize it;
- Second, they reveal an acknowledgement that nothing is perfect which makes it easier for someone to offer their real thoughts;

# Managing virtual meetings effectively ⭐️
The best quote about meetings:

            "if you had to identify, in one word, the reason why the human race has not achieved, and never will achieve, its full potential, that word would be meetings."

Meetings are of course necessary for having effective virtual teams, however, there are 2 main problems with most meetings:
- quantity problem: too many meetings;
- quality problem: too bad meetings;

We will discuss:
- what to do before the meeting;
- what to do during the meeting;
- what to do after the meeting;

## Summary of actions to this module:



## before the meeting:
Here's a list about what to do before a meeting:
- **Decide on a need**: Ther first question you should ask yourself before setting up a meeting is: "Do we really need to have this meeting?";
  - Think really, really hard about that question, and about whether you can write an email, set up a quick call, or use some other channel instead of setting up a meeting;
  - Saving half an hour of your time is huge. So "just like wars, meetings should be a last resort";
- **Define the objective**: Every single meeting should have an objective. This objective should be determined before you set up the meeting.
  - Complete one of these phrases:
    - The objective of this meeting is to make a desision on…
    - The objective of this meeting is to generate ideas about…
    - The objective of this meeting is to get status on…
    - The objective of this meeting is to make plans for…
- **Determine the attendees**: Think about who to invite to your meeting; a lot of times, individuals are invited just to "stay in the loop, but don't have any funcitonal reason to be there.
- **draft an agenda**:
- **sendinvite, agenda & reminders**:

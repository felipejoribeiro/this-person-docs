# Flux control in javascript
We can controll how the code is executed. There are conditionals and loops for us to explore, so lets go.

# Conditionals
First, the conditional statement can be summarized with:

```javascript
if (name === "John" || name === "john"){
    alert("hello John")
  } else if (name === "Clair" && name != "Vari") {
    alert("hello Clair")
  } else {
    alert("I don't know you")
  }
```

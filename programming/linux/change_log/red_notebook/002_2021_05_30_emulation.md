# Emulation
I was thinking in installing some emulators in this machine, as it allows me to study games in a more confortable manner. For that I installed the following programs:

- pcsx2 
    - For Playstation 2 games. 
    - Configs in .config/ directory.
    - Functions perfectly or arch linux.
    - Bios from console.

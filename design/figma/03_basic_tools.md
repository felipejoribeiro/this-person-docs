- **Text**: This is the text tool and it can be used by clicking or clicking and dragging. The first one creates a box that lets you write for ever without boundary limitations, and th drag option will try to contain the text on the determined area. You can put **zero** on the value to set the font size to **auto**, and change the value with the arrows keys or clicking and dragging with the mouse.

# Chapter 1: You have the gift to speak well
Speak in public can be hard for someone without practice. It can be hard for the most experienced ones even. It's never late to learn and the ability can be grown like muscles in a gym.

The worst error people usually make when talking to a crowd is to act differently from when they talk to some one. You must focus on acting as usual, to a more natural, relaxed and confident. **Crowd talk is like an animated talk**. You must act like you talk every day, but you must speak more loudly and with more energy in the expressions and gestures.

- Incrise the volume of your speech.
- Make your gestures and expressions more expressive to harmonize with the high volume of your voice.
- Incrise the pauses between sentences, so that you have more time to think and breath.

# Chapter 2: How to control the fear of talking to crowds
Every one has fear of talking to crowds. Even the most experienced speakers struggle with this. To deal with you must understand the reason of this fear and act over these to aliviante it.
The adrenaline rush is an evolutionary feature developed through the eons to make you run faster and beat stronger in face of any danger. Thing is, all of these normally don't help when in a public speak, they create the usual fear indicators so dreaded in these situations.
Controlling this adrenaline rush means decrease the sense of danger of the speak.
The fear can be caused by:

- Lack of understanding about the subject that you will talk about.
- Lack of practice with public speeches.
- Lack of self knowledge.

To combat each of these reasons you can take the following actions:

- Know the subject very well. Structure an order to expose the topics. But you can take insperation on the moment and insert new elements in your talk, with some improvisation. But having a backbone for your discourse will go a long way with containing your fears.
- Practice public talks. There are a lot of opportunities for practicing public talk, be sure to use these opportunities to gain some experience. The more you do it the less it will be something alien and unusual which helps with the anxiety as well.
- Understand your advantages. Know what you do best and based on that create a repertuar of tools that can be used proactively to enhance your presentations. Know what you do best is the first step to build unbearable confidence.
- When the fear comes (and it will) be prepared. Know that it's something transitory and will pass shortly. Start with something easy and calculated so that it isn't affected by emotions so easily until it all pass.
- Avoid stress relief from destructive habits. People tend to rely on bad methods for controlling the stress, like taking the celphone and keep it rotating in your hand, or resting your body's weight on only one leg, and then the other in a cycle. Stop doing that and focus on dealing with the root cause of the problem.

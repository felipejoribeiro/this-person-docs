// The Command Pattern Concept

interface ICommand {
    execute(): void
}

class Invoker {
    // The Invoker Class
    #commands: { [id: string]: ICommand }

        } else {
            console.log(`Command [${commandName}] not recognised`)
        }
    }
}

    // The Receiver

    runCommand1() {

    // A Command object, that implements the ICommand interface and
    // runs the command on the designated receiver

// The Client
// Create a receiver
const RECEIVER = new Receiver()

// Create Commands
const COMMAND1 = new Command1(RECEIVER)

// Register the commands with the invoker

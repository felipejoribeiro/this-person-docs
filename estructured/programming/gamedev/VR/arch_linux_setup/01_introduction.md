# Oculus Quest 2 game development on arch linux
To setup the **Oculus Quest 2** on arch linux, you need to install the following two programs from the **AUR**:

- alvr
- sidequest-bin

And from pacman:

- chromium

You will have to have steam installed as well to be enable to run **alvr**. And intall the **steamVR** through that.

You will need an **Oculus** development account and you need to give you credit card number or cellphone number to have that, and you will have to create an organization name too. Than, in the cellphone **Oculus** app you can enable the developer mode.

Now, you will install the **sidequest** and it will try to connect to the **Oculus quest 2**, you will have to accept the connection. Then, now you can install the **alvr** app on it via **sidequest**. With it both installed on your computer and you headset.

Now open **steam** and open the **Steam VR** app, it will ask for superuser capabilities and it will open a little window saying `Please plug in you VR headset`. 

Now you can close everything. And then open the **ALVR** app. It will open the steamvr window for you with a headset already listed and it will open a window with **ALVR** running.

Remember to check your firewall..

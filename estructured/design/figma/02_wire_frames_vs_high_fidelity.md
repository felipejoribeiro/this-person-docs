# Wire frames vs high fidelity
Here we will check the difference between wireframe and high fidelity.
- The wireframe approach is the so called **lo fi** method. It is important as an mvp of your design. It will not have colors or images, but will dictate where everything will be placed. So there will be a place holder for the images, and for the text (maybe lorem ipsum). And the buttons and everything else. As a way of making the user interface with all elements pretty fast and then test it with the client and some users before investing time in making it look beautiful. The foremost concern is the basic UX. Pick a boring colour, boring placeholder for the image. Even make it in black and white, or sketchy. The objective here is to describe functionality and not be pretty, but fast to be created and modified.

Here is an example made within the course:

- The high fidelity is where you put the images and text with proper fonts. Here the aesthetics are determined, so time must be spent with decisions concerning the strategy of the brand. And the wireframe is used to put the most important elements on the screen. Now the work is making then look nice for the client's persona.

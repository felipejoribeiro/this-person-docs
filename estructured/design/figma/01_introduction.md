## Introduction to figma User interface design
Here we will learn how to create beautiful User interface designs with **Figma**. The software is important for prototyping. You can create something that looks pretty much like a website, and you can test it with some interactive functionality. But it can't create the final product. It's only for development objectives. It gives some css, svg for developers, but not much else.

So use this software to create fast prototypes and show to your clients. And when everybody is happy you can pass to the developing estage. So the work flow goes like this.

It is used for general graphic design. So it can be used to create image stuff for instagram stories, or any other image related design job. It can be used as a substitute for adobe ilustrator for example, but it's main focus is to create prototypes for websites and apps.

## User interface versus user experience
- **User interface**: How well something looks. So this is more like an artistic or design problem. So focusing on the user persona and business persona and theme colors and this kind of thing.
- **User Experience**: How something works. So it is more related with the functionality. So testing is a big part of this job. You must take the interface from a pragmatic point of view, give it to the user and check if the results are good. So if the design elements and functionality elements are corroborating to a given objectives.

## Why we must have a target persona
To create an interface objectively you must have the **target audience** in mind. This will enable the designer to be specific in his decisions. Or else he will create a design to everyone or even worst to hinself. It will help when talking with the stake holders as well as all decisions will be made with the persona in mind with empathy for the chosen persona. This wil dictate the fonts, colors, information organization and availability, copyright and all sorts of things. So spend some time researching about personas.

## Some usefull terminology
- **Task flow**:Given an user journey, you must ensure all features necessary to said journey. This is considered a task flow. So, summarizing, a Task flow is a cake recipe that describes an user action. It's very specific and fairly simple.

         ------        -----------         -----------        ----------- 
        | home |      | Search    |       | Search    |      | Chose     |
        | page | -->  | something | --->  | Results   | ---> | a page    |
         ------        -----------         -----------        -----------


- **User flow**: It's more specific and complicated. Tries to descrive all options specific to the page design in a high level language. So differently from the task flow, it will have bifurcations with decision trees. Se we the user can click enter to search or click with the mouse on the button for example. It tries to consider all implicit decisions the user can make and create interface elements to suport these situations.

## Business brand strategy
Knowing the mission statement, values, positioning, persona, etc... These strategic features of the brand is very important when designing interfaces. Once more, these tools are important for being specific and pragmatic on your decisions.

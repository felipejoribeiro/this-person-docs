# Basic figma tools
Here we will discuss the basic tools that one have available to create user interfaces on figma.

- **Frame**: Basically they are screens, or pages. So if you create an app **UI**, you will create a frame of the size of the chosen phone screen. There are some premade sizes when you click on the frame tool, they are divided on various categories. You can determine the size in pixels as well if you prefer.

- **Text**: This is the text tool and it can be used by clicking or clicking and dragging. The first one creates a box that lets you write for ever without boundary limitations, and th drag option will try to contain the text on the determined area. You can put **zero** on the value to set the font size to **auto**, and change the value with the arrows keys or clicking and dragging with the mouse.

# Frames vs Groups
Frames can be described as groups with extra features. They allows the designer to stablish constrains to inner content and hide overflow elements and other fancy features. When they are inside other frames they lose the name that describe then and work like a group. It's interesting that in groups the content distorts with the group, like it was an image, while the frames just deals with singular applyied transforms.

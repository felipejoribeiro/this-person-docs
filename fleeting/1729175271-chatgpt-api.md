# ChatGpt API

ChatGpt is the open ai chatbot that is able to generate text like a human. It's powered by the `GPT` model family, with multi modal iterations like `gpt4o`.

With the API you can generate text, translate text, summarize text, answer questions, and more. Everything through a simple API request.

## Authentication

To authenticate with the API, you need to create an account in the [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/) platform. After that, you can create an API key in the `API keys` section.

There are user, organization and projects. After creating the key you can make api requests with the following headers:

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -H "OpenAI-Organization: org-q9MJOmBsp4hs5rJqkLgw3cdN" \
  -H "OpenAI-Project: $PROJECT_ID"
```

Specifying the organization and project is optional.

## Usage

After authenticating you can make requests for text completion. Here is an example of a request:

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
     "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
     "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Say this is a test!"}],
     "temperature": 0.7,
     "stream": false
   }'
```

This will return a response with a chat completion. Here you can see a response example:

```json
{
  "id": "chatcmpl-abc123",
  "object": "chat.completion",
  "created": 1677858242,
  "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 13,
    "completion_tokens": 7,
    "total_tokens": 20,
    "completion_tokens_details": {
      "reasoning_tokens": 0
    }
  },
  "choices": [
    {
      "message": {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "\n\nThis is a test!"
      },
      "logprobs": null,
      "finish_reason": "stop",
      "index": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

Partial completion streams are also possible with `"stream": true`. Here is an example of stream response:

```json
{
  "id":"chatcmpl-123",
  "object":"chat.completion.chunk",
  "created":1694268190,"model":"gpt-4o-mini",
  "system_fingerprint": "fp_44709d6fcb",
  "choices":[
    {
      "index":0,
      "delta":{
        "role":"assistant",
        "content":""
      },
      "logprobs":null,
      "finish_reason":null
    }
  ]
}

{
  "id":"chatcmpl-123",
  "object":"chat.completion.chunk",
  "created":1694268190,"model":"gpt-4o-mini",
  "system_fingerprint": "fp_44709d6fcb",
  "choices":[
    {
      "index":0,
      "delta":{
        "content":"Hello"
      },
      "logprobs":null,
      "finish_reason":null
    }
  ]
}

....

{
  "id":"chatcmpl-123",
  "object":"chat.completion.chunk",
  "created":1694268190,"model":"gpt-4o-mini",
  "system_fingerprint": "fp_44709d6fcb",
  "choices":[
    {
      "index":0,
      "delta":{},
      "logprobs":null,
      "finish_reason":"stop"
    }
  ]
}
```

Handling stream responses can be done by checking the `finish_reason` field. When it's `stop` the stream is finished.

## Debugging and troubleshooting

For observability reasons, it's important to log the requests and responses. This can be done by observing the response headers of each request. They contain meta data that is important for debugging and troubleshooting.

Here are a list of headers that are important:

- `openai-organization`: The organization that the request was made to.
- `openai-processing-ms`: The time it took to process the request in milliseconds.
- `openai-version`: The version of the API that was used.
- `x-ratelimit-limit-requests`: The limit of requests that can be made in a given time frame.
- `x-ratelimit-limit-tokens`: The limit of tokens that can be used in a given time frame.
- `x-ratelimit-remaining-requests`: The remaining requests that can be made in a given time frame.
- `x-ratelimit-remaining-tokens`: The remaining tokens that can be used in a given time frame.
- `x-ratelimit-reset-requests`: The time when the request limit will be reset.
- `x-ratelimit-reset-tokens`: The time when the token limit will be reset.

## Fine tuning

Fine tuning is the process to train the AI model for a specific task. It can be done by exposing the model to a dataset and run it's training methods to update its weights and biases.

For creating a fine tuning job in the OpenAI platform, you need to use the following endpoint:

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/fine_tuning/jobs \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "training_file": "file-BK7bzQj3FfZFXr7DbL6xJwfo",
    "model": "gpt-4o-mini"
    "suffix": "juritax-2024-10-17"
  }'
```

The response will be something like:

```json
{
  "object": "fine_tuning.job",
  "id": "ftjob-abc123",
  "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18",
  "created_at": 1721764800,
  "fine_tuned_model": null,
  "organization_id": "org-123",
  "result_files": [],
  "status": "queued",
  "validation_file": null,
  "training_file": "file-abc123"
}
```

Check status of fine tune:

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/fine_tuning/jobs/ft-AF1WoRqd3aJAHsqc9NY7iL8F \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY"
```

For canceling the job:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.openai.com/v1/fine_tuning/jobs/ftjob-abc123/cancel \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY"
```

### Training dataset

For training you will need a dataset. It must be in the following format:

```json
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "..."}, {"role": "user", "content": "..."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "..."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "..."}, {"role": "user", "content": "..."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "..."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "..."}, {"role": "user", "content": "..."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "..."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "..."}, {"role": "user", "content": "..."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "..."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "..."}, {"role": "user", "content": "..."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "..."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "..."}, {"role": "user", "content": "..."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "..."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "..."}, {"role": "user", "content": "..."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "..."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "..."}, {"role": "user", "content": "..."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "..."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "..."}, {"role": "user", "content": "..."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "..."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "..."}, {"role": "user", "content": "..."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "..."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "..."}, {"role": "user", "content": "..."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "..."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "..."}, {"role": "user", "content": "..."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "..."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "..."}, {"role": "user", "content": "..."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "..."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "..."}, {"role": "user", "content": "..."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "..."}]}
```

files must be in `.jsonl` format and up to `100MB` in size. For uploading the file you must use the following endpoint:

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/files \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -F purpose="fine-tune" \
  -F file="@mydata.jsonl"

```

And here is the response:

```json
{
  "id": "file-abc123",
  "object": "file",
  "bytes": 120000,
  "created_at": 1677610602,
  "filename": "mydata.jsonl",
  "purpose": "fine-tune"
}
```

# Piscicology of communication

Communication is the most important thing when managing virtual teams.

- Number 1 reason why managers fail at managing their virtual teams is ineffective communication;
  - Simply put, ineffective communication is the false assumption that what is being communicated to your virtual team is being 100% understood by your team (when in fact, it's mostly misunderstood or misconstrued);
  - Ineffective communication is the absolute core reason why the team as
    a whole ends up not executing according to plan or being proactively
    engaged in getting a project done.
- What bad communication leads:
  - a huge waste of time;
  - confusion among the team;
  - long and useless meetings;
  - endless back and forth emails;
  - team members that are not accountable or responsible;
  - a high degree of frustration;
- effective communication is a skill. CEOs and presidents sometimes struggle with the best way to communicate; Doing this with virtual teams is even more difficult as the body language is missing;
- Common issues faced in virtual teams:
  - trust issues;
  - cultural differences;
  - time zone differences;
  - accountability issues;
  - technology challenges;
  - lack of face-to-face interaction;
    All then can be solved with good communication.
- Knowing why and how to communicate is crucial.

## Summary of actions to this module:

- Understand that communication is everything in virtual teams;
- Observe how you currently communicate with your team and think about
  ways of improvement;
- To increase intimacy and cohesion, move up in the pyramid of tools and
  increase the variety of tools for communication;
- Remember about the curse of knowledge and explain things thoughtfully;
  - simplify the message;
  - put yourself in the other's shoes;
  - acknowledge that the curse exists;
- Observe how you typically respond to questions, make then all be “good” always.
  - Convince your team members to stop with the ugly and bad responses as well.
  - Good responses: the answer, yes, no, I don't know.

## Pyramid of communication

The team proximity spectrum:

- a team's composition can be seen as a point in a spectrum, with 100% virtual and 100% co-located team on the other hand:

           *--------------------------------------------*
          100%                                         100%

  virtual team co-located team

Changing the composition of your team to the right decreases the challenges; To being able to do that we should check the pyramid of communication. We have different technologies to communicate with virtual teams; The higher the tool is in the pyramid the more it promotes cohesion and intimancy.

- Face to face;
- Telepresence; (high devinition and life-size projections)
- Video conferencing; (audio and video)
- Phone/teleconferencing; (audio only)
- Instant messaging/social media;
- Email;

Moving up this pyramid will incriase intimancy and cohesion in your team;

## The curse of knowledge

The curse of knowledge is the idea that “individuals fail to ignore information they possess that others do not when predicting others behavior”. It's the biggest reason why you think you are communicating properly with someone when in reality you are not. This can be analysed in the tappers and listeners study which was conducted by elizabeth newton, a Ph.D. graduate student in psychology at Stanford University (1990).

- In the study there was two groupes, there were the tappers and the listeners.
- They gave the tappers a list of well-known songs (such as happy birthday to you);
- each tapper had to pick a song and tap out the rhythm to a listener by knocking on a table.
- They asked the listeners to guess the song by listening the taps.
- Furthermore, they asked the tappers to predict the odds that listeners would guess correctly. They assumed 50%.
- However, the real number was 2.5%.
- This was shocking to the tappers (the common response was something like “isn't the song obvious? How can they be so stupid”)

The reason this happened was that when the tappers were tapping, they were hearing the songs in their head. It was extremely hard for the tappers to imagine what it's like to lack that knowledge. This is the curse of knowledge. The knowledge affected the tapper's capacity of comunication. It happens throughout our society. It's a hard problem to avoid.

To avoid the curse of knowledge:

- The first step is to acknowledge that the curse exists in every single mean of communication because it's a problem with the information emitter, the medium doesn't matter.
- The second step is to train your empathy. Always put yourself in the other person's shoes (think about their experience, background, and culture) and how they might be viewing your communication. Remember when the portuguese came to brazil, the indigenous people didn't recognize the ships until people started coming out of it.
- The third is to simplify the message. “Explain this to me like I'm a 12 years old”.

## The 3 responses to questions

There are only three types of responses to any questions: The good, the bad and the ugly.

- The good: The good is when someone answers the question first, and then gives any additional information afterwards. It reduces ambiguity and doesn't waste anyone's time. Same way that the germans communicated through telegraph, as it wasn't a very reliable mean of communication.
- The bad: It stars with the sopporting information and then, after that, gives the response. It isn't efficient. It creates confusion and hurts the communication flow and ends up wasting a lot of time (that additional information might not be needed). Some indifiduals rely on this method to “soft the blow” of an answer, and for this, it's justifiable. However, using this as a default method should be avoided.
- The ugly: It doesn't respond the question. It's only a dump of supporting information that doesn't respond the question itself. It's the worst type of response, as no one gets an actual answer but everybody things they got it which causes confusion. Sometimes this occurs unintentionally, when the person responding things he delivered a response, when in fact the curse of knowledge made a strike. Other times its intentional, for example when politicians or public figures are avoiding answering a question, so they give convoluted side information dumps as an excuse for not answering it.

To answer all questions using the 'good' way of doing it, these four ways:

- The actual answer ('x is y, x has y, etc…');
- Yes;
- No;
- I don't know / I'm not sure; (when giving this type of answer, its good to follow up with your opinion, what your thoughs are about the subject, but with the disclosure that it's your opinion);

Good answers will make you an authority and will inspire confidence in your team; If a lot of people use the bad and the ugly, it's good to convince then to change their behavior.

# Principles of behavior change ⭐️

The principles of behavior change is about simple tactics that will make you influence your team to get things done. There are 4 power principles of behavior change that every person responds to — regardless of background, experience, culture, age, or gender. Applying one or more of those 4 principles is going to get you immediate results (there is no faster return on investment in terms of making your team get things done)

The four power principles:

- The Power of deadlines;
- The Power of assigning responsibility;
- The Power of specific tasks;
- The Power of writing;

Things to know about these principles:

- Each principle is backed up by specific research studies that explain the underlying reason behind why they work;
- Although the principles might sound simplistic, they are extremely powerful, so take then very seriously.
- The principles are independend from each other. You can start from a specific one without order.

## Summary of actions to this module:

- Always assign deadlines (with clear-cut dates for delivery, no ambiguity in objective);
  - avoid the **Parkinson's law**;
  - get feedback frequently (optimistic, pessimistic);
  - don't ever create too long deadlines;
- Avoid the **bystander effect** by always assigning tasks to individuals.
  - Use direct language;
  - Ask for volunteers;
  - Assign to individuals, always, even in group tasks;
- Always give specific tasks;
  - Know what you want before asking something to someone;
  - Be direct and precise with your words to transmit exactly what you want.
  - Always write your tasks down. Write then live and write then everywhere everytime.
- Write text live and write these tasks everywhere.

## The power of deadlines

We are all lazy. Most human beings are enherently lazy — we have an instinctive tendency to procrastinate with tasks that don't have a sense of urgency associated with them. We typically delay working on stuff whenever we get the chance. And we usually come up with false alibis such as waiting until we're in a better mood or waiting for more information.

There are plenty of psychological reasons for procrastinating, but one bug reason behind why we take a lot of time to finish a task is the Parkinson's law:

                  "Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion"

So if a task would typically take 1 hour to complete, then if you assign a 3-hour deadline to it, it will take up the full 3 hours to get done. So a task that doesn't have a deadline will never get done. And it applies both to self-imposed tasks and assigned tasks.

Deadlines provide:

- The developing of a sense of urgency;
- Accountability to the team members;
- A sense of encouragement;
- Help in prioritie determinagion;
- Sense of accomplishment;
- Force teams to get things done;

Three rules for setting deadlines:

- be reasonable: Set deadlines with a good notion about the work that will be performed, don't alocate too little time for a task, because if it isn't reasonable the person you are assigning it to will notice, and it will have the contrary effect; Always work with feedback for that; A good way if by asking for “optimistic”, “pessimistic” and “most likely” scenarios.
- Be clear-cut: Be 100% clear-cut about when the actual deadline is (day, date, and time) (no space for ambiguity);
- always use deadlines: What doesn't have deadlines will not be completed. It's even okay if it's a fake deadline. Leave it always lurking in the backlog to let your team know it's important and one day will have to be done. (if a deadline is too far off, create intermediate deadlines for checkpoints. Big deadlines has the same effect as no deadline);

## The power of assigning responsability

The case of kitty genoveses: she was a young woman who was stabbed to death in New York City in 1964. Over the course of half an hour, she was attacked three times on the street as neighbors watched from their windows. There were 38 witnesses but no one called the police during the attack. The case caused a huge outcry in the community and prompted psychologists to study the behavior. They conducted one study were a something bad happened. When the subject being examined though that he was the only one seeing, he got to help in 85% of the times, wile if he tough that there was more people watching he would go help in only 31% of times.

This is called the **bystander effect**, it says that, the bigger the number of bystanders in an emergency, the less likely it is that any one of them will help. It is closely realted to the **diffusion of responsibility** concept where people less likely will take responsibility where there are more people present.

        "everyone responsibility is no one responsibility"

How it applies in virtual teams:

- if people are not willing to take action to help someone who is dying due to bystander effect, then they will probably not take responsibility for assigned tasks in groups.
- In virtual teams, this effect is increased due to the lack of face-to-face interaction.

To avoid the effect:

- Use direct language: Let people know exactly who is responsible for each task at hand by the team. Avoid ambiguity;
- Ask for volunteers: It has two advantages. It increases the chances for the task to being done because a concept called **internal consistency**, which makes self assigned tasks more likely to be completed and let people chose what they have want to work on; If no one volunteers then you step up and asign someone. All tasks should have a responsible personel;
- Asign individuals and not groups: Always assign tasks to individual people and never to groups. Even if there are more individuals doing said task. One person should be chosed to be the "reporter" of said endeavour.

## The power of specific tasks

Virtual teams have difficults understanding social cues, such as gestures, facial expressions, and tone of voice. You have to be precise and direct with them, be very specific about your expectations, and avoid sarcasm and nonverbal communication.

Two rules for assigning specific tasks:

- Know what you want: Nine times out of ten people don't know what they want, and they really are in brainstorm mode. (but they think they know what they want). So before asking something from someone, first, finish the brainstorm phase, or be explicity that what you are proposing is a suggestion, and what are the options.
- Be direct: You must get to the point as fast as possible. You must say what you want using the right words. Don't leave space open to interpretation or assumptions.

## The power of writing

In an old hidden camera tv show, producers placed a fake sign on the highway between pennsylvania and delaware that read "delaware closed". Some drivers ignored the sign, but others stopped and believed it. One concerned driver even asked "when will it be opened? My family lives there".

- Written words have immense power due to the **"deference to authority"** principle. They carry a much higher authoritative message than verbal ones.
- Writting tasks down dramatically increases the probability that they will get done; This will also help people remember them better (as opposed to verballly assigned taks);

Rules for writting tasks down:

- write tasks live: Given the chance, the best way to get commitment from someone is to write out the tasks “live”, during a conference call; The participants can see you registering the task; Even if they can't see you if they can hear you typing has already good effect;
- write tasks everywhere and everytime: Never rely on verbal task requests, even minor ones. These tasks should be written everywhere where your team most spend time looking at. (meeting notes, spreadsheets, follow-up emails, eletronic whiteboards).

# Tactics of influence and persuasion ⭐️

The tactics of influence a persuasion is about methods to influence your team members to do what you need them to do. Unlike the previous module about principles of behavior change, which included a set of 4 principles that worked together, this module is about a fragmented list of strategies and tactics that you can use depending on the situation you're in.

## Summary of actions to this module:

- use one or more of Cialdini's 6 principles of influence to persuade your virtual team to get things done: Reciprocation, commitment to consistency, social proof, authority, liking, and scarcity.
- Increase the compliance rate of assigned tasks in your virtual team by using the word “because” in every meeting, email, IM, and voice message. It is best to include a well-thought-out reason after the word, even though a solid justification is not really needed;
- Use the 6 steps process to ensure 100% commitment by your team on really important tasks: Get then to say it, get a time frame, develop an obligation, stress importance, confirm action, show appreciation;
- To find out what someone is really thinking, isolate them and then ask them one of the following four questions: what would it take for you to love this idea? How do you think i can make this better? What would it take for you to be really excited about this? What would you do differently?

## Cialdini's 6 principles of influence

Thes is based on the book "Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion".

There are 6 rules described in this book:

- **Reciprocation**: Individuals have a tendency to return a favor; If you give someone somehthing of value, they are more likely to give you something back in the future;
  - examples:
    - help a team member with something that's not typically part of your responsibility;
    - send someone a token of appreciation as gift (e.g., employee gift-giving programs);
- **Commitment and consistency**: Individuals have a deep desire to be consistent. People will behave consistently with decisions and choices that they have already made (even if the original incentives of the decidion have been removed);
  - examples:
    - ask a team member to do a small request (with a high probability of acceptance) before asking for a bigger related task down the line;
    - Ask for volunteers to complete a task instead of assigning it to them. (The volunteer will aim to stay consistent with their choice)
- **Social Proof**: Individuals tend to do what other people are doing; People pursue the "safety in numbers" among other individuals, particularly when unsure about a decision;
  - examples:
    - A person is more likely to put money in a tip jar if he sees that other people ahead of him have already put in a tip;
    - Get buy-in on important decisions separately from team members before discussing them openly in a group;
    - Reference best practices that are published by well-known standards and frameworks (e.g., PMBOK, ITIL) as social proof to push back on any ineffective processes.
- **Authority**: Individuals tend to obey someone with a higher degree of authority; people get persuaded by individuals in positions of authority, such as uniformed personnel ("if an expert says it, it must be true");
  - example:
    - The _milgram experiment_ at _Stanford University_, showed that subjects were willing to give painful electric shocks to another person because they were instructed to do so by an individual with an authoritative role.
    - Borrow authority from your own superior (or from the team members' respective superiors) to stress the importance of certain tasks;
    - Set expectations within the team that you are ultimately accountable for the success of a project (assigned authority);
- **liking**: Individuals tend to be influenced by people that they like; people will more likely buy somehting from someone who is similar to them;
  - example:
    - Get to know your team members personally — their likes/dislikes, families, hobbies, etc. — through informal discussions;
    - Focus on discussing any common similarities between you and them whenever you get the chance (background, parental status, culture, favorite sport teams, etc.);
    - Share articles, videos, or events that you think your team members might be interested in;
- **Scarcity**: Individuals tend to want things more when their availability is limited; People will demand more of something when it is scarce in supply;
  - example:
    - limited-time offers in car dealerships or special offers on clearance items in stores result in an increase in sales because of the scarcity principle;
    - Use terms such as “unique opportunity” or "once in a lifetime event" to entice team members into working on tasks that are highly-visible;
    - Stress time constraints and deadlines as a way to highlight time scarcity as a factor;

## The influential power of one word

In 1978, Ellen Langer of Harvard University, co-authored a social psychology paper about how people react to placebic information; She conducted an experiment to understand how people who were waiting in line to make photocopies on a xerox sho were waiting in line to make photocopies on a xerox machine would react when someone cut in front of them; The experiment is commonly referred to as the _Xerox study_;
The following three questons were used to see how people waiting in line would react:

- Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the Xerox machine, because I'm in a ruch?
- Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the Xerox machine?
- Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the Xerox machine, because I have to make copies? (fake justification)

The first request got a 94% of conversion rate.
The second request got a 60% of conversion rate.
The third request got a 93% of conversion rate.

Which is interesting as the third request didn't have a valid justification, but it got almost the same conversion as the first with a valid excuse.

The thing ta causes that is the **because** word, It is very powerfull. It is highly influential because it triggers an automatic compliance response, regardless of what is the justification. The study showed that using the word "because" incriased in 33% the compliance rate of any request; This is probably due to the fact that we are hard-wired by our relative and teachers as children to accept the reasoning that comes after the “because” no matter what.

The main takeway:

        use the word "because" everywhere to increase influence

## 6 steps to ensure 100% commitment

For high stakes tasks and projects, you can use a methodical step-by-step process that ensures 100% commitment by the person who is assigned to the task; This 6-step process builds on teh previous principles of behavior and persuasion;

Disclaimer: Use the process sparingly — overusing it could backfire, and team members might become immune to it.

Here are teh 6 steps:

- ask:
  - **Get them to say it**: After you assign a task to someone, try to get them to say the task or repeat it back to you; Have then saying the words increase commitiment;
    - example: At the end of the meeting say something like: "Just to make sure, I'd like to go around the table and confirm what everyone is going to be working on next";
  - **Get a time frame**: If you already assigned a deadline to the task, then ask teh person to repeat or confirm that as well; If you have not assigned a deadline to the task, then ask how long it would take (you should always have a deadline);
    - example: "Great, when will we be able to get that done?"
  - **Develop an obligation**: Develop a sense of obligation, to let the person know that because of their help, you will be altering your original plans; The idea is to let the person understand that a withdrawl of their commitment will result in some sort of disturbance for you, or someone else;
    - example: "Ok then, I'll move my other scheduled appointments to make sure i'm free on that day to discuss the draft…"
  - **Stress importance**: Develop a sense of conscience to let the person know that you're now dependent on them to get the task done. You want to stress the importance of the task as well as the negative consequences that might occur if it doesn't get done;
    - example: "Just as a side note, I will get reprimanded publicly if this isn't done by tuesday, so it's really important.";
- chose:
  - **Confirm action**: Close the request by confirming that the action will be carried out. End the meeting or conversation using a solid and concise verbal confirmation phrase;
    - example: "So I'll devinitely be getting a copy of this on friday, right?"
- the follow-up:
  - **Show appreciation**: After you make the request and sometime before the due date of the task approaches, follow-up with the person by expressing appreciation; Let the person know how much you value their efforts of following through on a task and that they're the kind of person who gets the job done;
    - example: "Sarah, I really appreciate your help on this task — I know I can count on you to get it finished on time";

## How to know what they're really thinking

It is very challenging to know exactly what someone's thoughts are about a task, a project, or a deliverable; asking a question like "what do you really think about htis?" would not necessarily give you a thruthful answer (because of human nature and/or politics);

There is a two steps process that never fails to let you know exactly what someone is really thinking:

- **Isolate them**: the best way to make someone comfortable about speaking freely is to isolate them from the rest of the team; It reduces political repercutions of the given feedback; Schedule a separate one-on-one call or meeting with the person to discuss the topic;
- **Ask them one of four questions**:
  - **What would it take for you to love this idea?**;
  - **How do you think I can make this better?**;
  - **What would it take for you to be really excited about this?**;
  - **What would you do differently?**;

All four of these questions do a couple of things:

- They assume the person likes the idea, which makes them more confortable to criticize it;
- Second, they reveal an acknowledgement that nothing is perfect which makes it easier for someone to offer their real thoughts;

# Managing virtual meetings effectively ⭐️

The best quote about meetings:

            "if you had to identify, in one word, the reason why the human race
            has not achieved, and never will achieve, its full potential,
            that word would be meetings."

Meetings are of course necessary for having effective virtual teams, however, there are 2 main problems with most meetings:

- quantity problem: too many meetings;
- quality problem: too bad meetings;

We will discuss:

- what to do before the meeting;
- what to do during the meeting;
- what to do after the meeting;

## Summary of actions to this module:

- Do the following 5 things before every meeting:
  - decide on a need;
  - define the objective;
  - determine the attendees;
  - draft an agenda;
  - send invite, agenda, and reminders;
- Do the following 5 things during every meeting:
  - have a leader;
  - go through the agenda;
  - remain on topic (and time);
  - capture meeting menutes;
  - close with a review;
- Do the following 2 things after every meeting:
  - distribute teh meeting minutes;
  - follow up with a summary;
- Follow these general guidelines to schedule meetings:
  - have fewer meetings;
  - batch on the same day;
  - batch on the same part of the day;
  - think about spacing;

## Before the meeting:

Here's a list about what to do before a meeting:

- **Decide on a need**: Ther first question you should ask yourself before setting up a meeting is: "Do we really need to have this meeting?";
  - Think really, really hard about that question, and about whether you can write an email, set up a quick call, or use some other channel instead of setting up a meeting;
  - Saving half an hour of your time is huge. So "just like wars, meetings should be a last resort";
- **Define the objective**: Every single meeting should have an objective. This objective should be determined before you set up the meeting.
  - Complete one of these phrases:
    - The objective of this meeting is to make a desision on…
    - The objective of this meeting is to generate ideas about…
    - The objective of this meeting is to get status on…
    - The objective of this meeting is to make plans for…
- **Determine the attendees**: Think about whom to invite to your meeting; a lot of times, individuals are invited just to "stay in the loop, but don't have any funcitonal reason to be there. A smaller number of attendees increase focus and engagement.
- **Draft an agenda**: Every meeting has an agenda which explains what the meeting is about. It doesn't need to be a document. It could be just a bullet point or a short paragraph about the meeting subject. Start the agenda with the important topics first. Set a time limit to each topic. Explain if any material needs to be reviewed or if any input is required before the meeting.
- **Sendinvite, agenda & reminders**: Send out the agend ahead of time (include it in the calendar invite) so that individuals have time to prepare. In addition, send out reminders before the meeting to insist that all attendees review any material (and come prepared).

## During the meeting:

Every meeting:

- **should have a leader**: This person should moderate the meeting; This person is responsible for achieving the stated objectives of the meeting and for capturing any notes; ideally the leader would be you (as the manager of the virtual team), but in some cases, you might assign that role to someone else;
- **go through the agenda**: Start with the meeting objective and state the outcome you want to achieve; ('at the end we should have this'); Walk through the rest of the agenda and tell your team members what you expect them to talk about or discuss;
- **remain on topic (and time)**: stick to the agenda items — hold people accountable for their time limits and don't let them stray off in different directions; the agenda should work as an alibi to make sure everyone remains on topic (and ask individuals to take any side conversation offline) - this is obvious but no one does it; if anyone joins late, avoid repeating any information and carry on with your meeting; end meetings on time (use a visual countdown timer if you have to);
- **capture meeting minutes**: Focus on capturing 3 things every single meeting: risks, issues, and action items:
  - Risks are problems that you might encounter in the future.
  - Issues are problems you are currently encountering.
  - Action items are tasks the team needs to work on next;
    Assign owners for tehse things when they are found. Also capture notes about every decision or ideas that have been discussed.
    Remember: No documentation means useless meeting; everything that isn't written don't exist;
- **close with a review**: A few minutes before teh meeting ends, do a full review of the notes you took; Start with the action items first (and verbally confirm the actions owners and deadlines); then talk about resks, issues and any other decisions or ideas that were discussed (if you have the time); summarizing what was said in the meeting is the best way to ensure understanding;

## After the meeting:

You must:

- **distribute meeting minutes**: after the meeting is over, distribute the meeting minutes to everyone who attended the meeting (as well as anyone who missed it), and possibly others who need to be kept informed; you could also upload the meeting minutes to a document repository for future reference; while there's some debate about whether meeting minutes are effective (most people don't really read them), they might be necessary (or even required) in some projects to track issues if they surface later on;
- **follow up with a summary**: after the meeting is over, always follow up with a sumary email that specifically highlights who are working on what and when everything is due; although those actions are already included in the meeting minutes that you distributed there's a lot of power in highlighting them separately; one best practice is to send out an email with an action list and include the meeting minutes as an attachment (in you MS Word or PDF) to minimize the number of emails you send out;

## Meeting scheduling guidelines

This gives you an overview about the best practices. Keep in mind that these guidelines are only general heuristics that will give you a good sense of drection; every team and project is different, so do whatever you think is helpful based on your specific situation;

- **have fewer meetings**: Have the minimal number of meetings possible. For recurring meetings (such as status meetings), start with fewer meetings and add more if you need to. Don't do it the other way around;
- **batch on the same day**: try to bach meetings (specially recurring meetings) on the same day of the week; this minimizes the number of interruptions, the loss of productivity, and the switching cost associated between work time ane meeting time (team members will have a higher chance of being "in the zone" for the rest of the week; Tuesday is the best day for meetings because it is early in the workweek, but not too early (like monday);
- **batch on the same part of the day**: Try to batch meetings on the same part of the day; chose either mornings or afternoons, but avoid during both; if this occurs what will happen is that people will not work in anything else; the general preference is to batch meetings in the early mornings because this will give team members the rest of the day to work on tasks;
- **think about spacing**: Put some thought into the spacing between meetings and how much time is available for folks to work on tasks before their next meeting; avoid back-to-back meetings for productivity purposes: at a minimum, have 30 minutes between meetings to consolidate notes and send emails, and to give yourself a mental break;

# Choosing and evaluating the right technology ⭐️

Technology is an important factor in managing virtual teams, but the role it plays is a lot less important than you might think;

- there are highly successful, multi-million dollar virtual projects being run using only PowerPoint, excel and plain-old email;
- there are lots of projects that utterly fail even though they were being run using the latest versions of MS Project, sharepoint, primavera, webex, togomeeting, basecamp, and every other cool tool under the sun;

90 percent of the time, the technology virtual managers use is more than enough to make them succeed in their projects;

A lot of virtual team managers focus solely on the technology tools themselves; but the truth is that nobody cares about the technology itself but the solution to the problem that the technology solves.

    "People don't want a quarter-inch drill, they want a quarter-inch hole"

Here we will see how to find the best tools for the work; there is also a list over 40 technology tools that you can choose from (categorized under 10 different functions);

## sumary of actions:

- understand that although technology is very important in managing virtual teams, the technology itself is overrated; you probably do not need to change the technology tools you're currently using: 90 percent of times, what you have is more than enough to make a successfull project.
- Chosing tools is difficult because the following reasons:
  - new technologies are created every day;
  - features keep changing;
  - features overlap;
  - budget/time/team constraints;
- use these rules to chose software:
  - use the minimum number of tools possible;
  - go with the least number of vendors;
  - avoid popular technology;
  - choose saas over traditional software;
  - solicit feedback from the team;
  - pick tools you're comfortable with;
- check the list as ther might be good tools there for your team;

## Why choosing the perfect tool is hard?

There are 4 important reasons:

- **New technologies every day**: there are hundreds of tools that already exist to manage virtual teams, and new technologies and tools are developed every single day; third-party add-ons and pluggins that work with those tools add to the complexity of choosing; so the best option you choos today might not be the best option you choos in a week;
- **Features keep changing**: in addition to new technologies being developed, the tools you are using are changing every day; companies are always in competition mode, they want to emulate what others are doing, and offer more for their customers; moreover, the fact that most applications today are sold under the saas model, means that it's very easy for companies to change or add features to their products;
- **Features overlap**: multiple technologies have features that overlap with each other; for example, meeting software that focuses on screen sharing now allows you to set up video conferencing; instant messaging software that focuses on real-time chatting now also serves as a documet repository; so not only do you have to make decisions on which set of tools works best, but you also have to think about which features whithin each tool you're going to use, and which features you're goint to ignore;
- **Budget/time/team constraints**: There are a lot of constraints that you might have to deal with which will limit your options:
  - budget contraints: how much money you have to spend;
  - time constraints: how much time you have for a project;
  - team constraints: how technically competent the team is, and how open the members are to learning something new;

## the 7 golden rules for choosing the best technology

use the rules as a framework that gives you a good sense of directino about what to select; if you are currently using technology tools within our team, then use those rules as guidelines ro reevaluate what you're using; pick what is best for your context:

- **use the minimal number of tools**: the most important rule; start small and add more tools if needed; the more tools are used the higher the switching cost, and the higher the potential of "tool abandonment"; all-in-one solutinos work best here;
- **go with the least number of vendors**: in addition to choosing the minimum number of tools, try to stay within the realm of the same vendor; they should have better integration and fewer headaches on workflow coupling;
- **avoid popular technology**: a lot of managers and organizations get caught up in the hype of the latest technology (only because it sounds attractive); however popular technology not always correspond to helpful technology; focus on benefits and features instead of names and brands;
- **choose saas over traditional software**: software is delivered on demand; it is purchased as a service and not as a product; cloud solutions are the best option for virtual teams;
- **solicit feedback from the team**: if you have the opportunity, solicit feedback from your virtual team about what they think ov certain tools;
- **pick tools you're comfortable with**: as a leader of virtual team, you have to become the goto expert in the technology tools you use;
- **accept that no tool is perfect**: even after following all rules, there's always something wrong, so don't feel bad if some feature is missing, remember that technology is not everything;

# Building trust in your virtual environment ⭐️

Trust is the assured reliance on the character, ability, strength or thruth of someone or something; creating a high degree of trust among a virtual team is vital to the success of the team; individual who trust each other product more; a lack of trust results on a lack of commitment, poor team performance and negative energy; establishing trust is relatively complicated because of so many factors involved; however, developing and building trust among a virtual team can be developed;

Here we will see how to develop the trust among your virtual team;

## summary of actions:

- learn the formula for trus: trust = reliability + likeability
  - you should increase both these elements to incriase trust;
  - remember about the megacommunication;
- to increase the reliability in your team:
  - verify skills;
  - be explicity;
  - lead by example;
  - count on others;
- to increase the likeability in your team:
  - get personal;
  - encourage social interactions;
  - over communicate;
  - meet face to face;
  - be positive;

## The secret formula for trust

Remember: trust is equal to reliability plus likeability; the reliability results in cognitive trust (evidence of performance, reliability, and competence) while likeability results in affective trust (social bonds developed in a reciprocal relationship);

So, to make a team have trust among it's members, you must increase the likability and reliability among them; so, the objective of a the leader should be:

     "Increase and sustain both the reliability and likeability factors among a team to keep trust high"

If there was a single "common denominator" rule that helps you establish trust among a virtual team, it would be a rule that's summed up in a single word:

     "megacommunication"

Megacommunication is frequently communicating with your team (every day or every other day) to keep in touch with them; it helps keeping trust because it positively affects both the reliability and likeability factors of the trust equation. Even if there is no specific reason to comunicate, you must make sure that your team is communicating frequently.

## How to increase reliability

Reliability is the ability and dependability of a team member to accomplish a task according to pre-defined objectives; it is based on assessments o performance and competence of a team member; it is referred to as the cognitive trust component, and is a function of a person's ability and integrity;

To increse reliability you can follow these 4 main tactits and make your team members do it as well:

- **Verify skills**: the main root cause of a lack of reliability among virtual teams is a lack of proper team skills. There are technical skills and collaboration skills; you should verify these skills before starting the project.
- **Be explicit**: be as explicit as you can with expectations and requests when communicating with your team; you cannot rely on someone to do a task if they're not 100% clear on what they have to do; say exactly what you want (and when you want it), and don't leave requests open to interpretation or assumptions; keep communicating throughout the task timeframe to make sure there are no misunderstandings;
- **Lead by example**: demonstrate your leadership by setting an example of how reliable you are to your own virtual team; your team looks up to your own behavior as the standard reference point of how they should behave; if you're not reliable with your own commitments, you implicitly give your team permission to behave accordingly; when you say you will do something, just do it;
- **Count on others**: this might sound counterintuitive, but counting on others to do their job will increase their level of reliability; research shows that "a propensity to believe others can be counted on to do what they say they will do is an important precursor to the development of trust"; so show your team members that you're trusting them, and they'll become more thrustworthy;

Keep in mind that no matter how much you try increasing the level of feliability, there are certain people who are just poor performers; those poor performers will affect the entire team by freeriding, and creating a negative atmosphere of distrust; you can try addressing poor performance issues by having honest conversations about conduct however, understand that ther's only so much you can do, and sometimes, letting team memebers go is the best solution for you and the team;

## how to increase likeability

The Likeability is the forming of emotional ties between members of a team; it is a result of social bonds developed in a reciprocal relationship between two people; likeability is referred to as the affective trust component, and is based on assessments of benevolence;

Likeability in a virtual team can be increased similar to how it's increased in co-location teams, but it takes a little more effort and time;

you can increase likeability among your team by following 5 main tactics; use those tactics with your team, and encourage your team members to use them among each other; The objective is to increase an sustain trust;

The 5 tactics:

- **get personal**: virtual teams can feel very transactional and dry. Everyone is usually focused on completing tasks and getting their job done and not spending time on informal conversations; however, getting to know your team members on a personal level is one of the fastest ways to increase likeability; learn about your team members' families, vacation plans, and hobbies through informal discussions; lead by example, start sharing personal stuff about yourself and they might follow suit; tis ok to ask some personal questions, but be careful about getting too personal;
- **encourage social interactions**: one major drawback of virtual teams is that they lack the "water cooler" effect; (where emplyees in a physical office typically gather around a water cooler to chat); encouraging social interactions will help you create a virtual water cooler to increase team likeability and cohesion; to accomplish that, you can start or end conversations unrealted to work; use the power of small gives: share articles, videos or events that you think your team members might be interested in; also schedule separate meetings ( or portions of meetings ) dedicated to team building or team bonding exercises;
- **over communicate**: the "propinquity effect" states that the more you interact with someone the more likely you will become friends with the person. Repeat exposure through over communication among your team will eventually lead to an increse in liking; stay in touch at least once every day with your team members, even if it's not absolutely essential;
- **meet face to face**: meeting at least once is the single best thing you can do to increase liking among yout team; bringing a team together in one room could be a large expense, but it's worth it down the line, particularly in long-term projects; if meeting face to face is not possible due to budgetary or other constraints, then use video conferencing as a secondary option;
- **be positive**: No one enjoys hanging around individuals who are constantly negative and pessimistic; even though it is quite natural to go through some highstress times while working in virtual teams, how you react during those times is going to affect the team's environment; having a constant positive attitude (and encouraging others to do the same) will increase the level o likeability among the team;

# Great email and phone techniques ⭐️

We constantly get bombarded by emails, meetings, phone, calls, and presentations on a daily basis; email is the worst: accordingly to a mckinsey study, the average worker spends over 28 percent of their workweek managing email; assuming a 40 hour workweek, that means the average workier spends over 11 hours per week on email alone; some managers receive between 100 and 300 emails a day;

Email is still the most commonly used and widely accepted channel of communication for virutal teams; even the latest technologies ( including social network tools ) still rely on email as the primary method for notifications - which adds even more email to everyone's inbox; email is not going away anytime soon and you shoud manage it effectively to increase productivity;

We will se a list of practices to enhance the way you communicate via email and voice channels;

## summary of actions:

- implement these strategies for email communication:
  - use batching;
  - use if-then statements;
  - use mailing lists;
  - know when to avoid email;
  - create an email charter;
- use these techiniques to better emails:
  - keep emails short and simple;
  - put things in context;
  - write the perfect subject line;
  - use separate emails for separate topics;
  - use "reply-all" and "cc" sparingly;
  - highlight your call to actions;
- understand the inportance of good voice;
  - tone;
  - speed;
  - enunciation;
  - silence;

## five strategies for managing email overload

fhe following 5 strategies will help managing your own email load when communicating with a virtual team; you should share these with your coworkers as well to increase overwall efficiency;

- **use batching**: Reading email multiple times through the day hurts your brain and should be avoided; batching is simply processing your email at specif times as opposed to on a rolling basis to significantly reduce interruptions; Tim Ferriss recommend reading email only twice a day: once at lunch time and then again 4pm; During this moment, process these emails (reply, defer, delegate, etc); You can do the same with voice messages;
- **use if-then statements**: Your main objective of managing email overload is to minimize the number of back and forth emails between you and your team; the idea is to create a "one-shot, one-kill" self-sustaining emails that give the recipient everything they need to know without the need for them to get back to you for clarification; this puts onus on you to create a well-crafted email before sending it out (which will save you more time down de line); Use event statements: "if you cannot send me that final draft by this friday, then send me whatever incomplete draft you have by then anyway";
- **use mailing lists**: Mailing lists are single email addresses that automatically send aout email to multiple email recipients of that list; making that can save a lot of time, and make sending emails to your group;
- **know when to avoid email**: Sending emails on a friday evening or at the start of a national holiday might not be the best idea if you want a response; so use instant message and other communication mediums in these circunstances;
- **create an email charter**: put together a short documet that explains the "rules of engagement" of email among your team; keep it simple and tailor it to your won team's needs; lead by example, and follow the chart; schedule a meeting to go through the email charter. It can be something like this: https://email-charter.github.io/

## 6 killer email tactics that get things done

the following 6 tactics will help minimize miscomunication issues samong your team members:

- **keep emails short and simple**: If you cant make it simple, you didn't thought throughtly enough; One paragraph is enough on most cases; if it a must, then give the text space to breath, include white spaces between the paratraphs;
- **put things in context**: add the context to the body of the email; for example, replying "yes, i agree", is bad, describe what you are talking with detail; avoid the curse of knowledge;
- **write the perfect subject line**: to have your email to stand out:
  - include the recipient's name in the body of the email;
  - a summary with few words, about what the email is about;
  - a deadline as they create a sense of urgency;
- **use separate emails for separate topics**: One of the biggest causes of miscommunication in email messages is combining multiple topics in a single email thread; use separate emails for separate topics;
- **use "reply-all" and "CC" sparingly**: recipients who don't need to be copied falsely assume that they have to read all the messages and therefore cannot just ignore them; this causes a huge productivity issue and is a big time waste; in the long run people start just ignoring these emails as they usually don't concern then, so don't use reply all or cc; if that is a must, highlight why i had to do so in the beggining of the message;
- **highlight your call to actions**: make it obvious the action the person must perform; it should be simple and acessible, with bullet points or somehting like that; even other colors or fonts could be used;

## How to use your voice to your advantage

During a meeting, there's what you say and how you say it; the second one is your voice; if you don't use it correctly you will lose your audience's attention;
The four things to consider:

- **tone**: pitch, quality and volume; low pitch or volume voice will lose people; the voice must be clear, moderate and confident; to know how do you sound you can record yourself during a meeting and see the meeting some days later;
- **speed**: how fast you talk; if you talk too fast, it may sound intimidating and it can be difficult to understand; a slow voice may lose interest by the audience and be too boring; you should find a good mean term; that is called a good pace;
- **Enunciation**: pronouncing a word or phrase clearly; put the extra effort to say clearly your vocabulary;
- **silence**: know how to use silence; it can help as it gives a breathing room, and you can grab your team's attention with it as well;

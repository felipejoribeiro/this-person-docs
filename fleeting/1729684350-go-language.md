# The GO language

## Database integration

Integrating go with databases is a common task. Here are some of the most popular libraries for database integration:

### Migrations

To integrate golang with a database, the `golang-migrate` library can be used to manage your database. It supports all major databases like ` PostgreSQL`, `MySQL`, `MongoDB`, `SALite`, and more. It' s a cli utility and a go library. It can be used both ways.

Here are some command examples:

```bash
migrate create # create new migrations
migrate goto $1 # migrate to a specific database version
migrate up $1 # apply all changes up by $1 migrations
migrate down $1 # rollback migrations back $1 migrations
```

### CRUD operations

For golang **CRUD** operations there are great ORM libraries. Here are some of the best picks:

- **DATABASE/SQL**: The standard library for database operations. It's fast and straightforward. Requires manual mapping of fields. Easy to make mistakes.
- **GORM**: Operations are already implemented with short porduction code. Requires specific **API** learning curve. Runs slow in comparison to other libraries.
- **SQLX**: Very fast and easy to use. The fields are mapped via query text and struct tags. Failures won't occur until runtime.
- **SQLC**: It's a code generator that generates code from SQL queries. It's very fast and type safe. It's a great choice for large projects. Errors in SQL queries are caught in compile time. Only supports **PostgreSQL**, **MySQL** and **SQLite**.

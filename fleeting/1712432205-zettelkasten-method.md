# THE ZETTELKASTEN METHOD

<span style="text-align: center; width: 100%; font-size: 0.75em">
    
The Zettelkasten method is the most multidisciplinary method of knowledge building. It's based on a single container approach, where all notes are linked to one another. And the relationships between notes are the main source of organization.

## ✾ Introduction

"Slip box" in German, the method was created by Niklas Luhmann, a German sociologist.. It's a method of note taking based on little documents linked to one another. You have the _zettel_ which is a note and the _kasten_ which is the container. Here we implement this method with markdown files as the notes and directories as the containers.

> Interesting enough, this method was first implemented in a physical way. With little notes and boxes that were ordered based in their identification numbers. So when linking notes, the author would write the identification number to stablish the link. It was a very laborious process, made simpler with the advent of computers and the hyperlinking.

This method isn't intended to make note taking easier, or more efficient, but to make knowledge building more effective. Observing the relationships between notes will show the author the connections between ideas, and writing these notes with connections in mind will make the author think more deeply and broadly about the subject.

## ✾ The notes

About the notes, there are three categories:

- **Permanent notes**: are created by revising and synthesizing fleeting notes and literature notes. They are intended to be permanent and are the main source of knowledge;
- **Literature notes**: notes that are taken from content that is not created by the author. It has references to the original content, and synthesis of the content;
- **Fleeting notes**: momentary notes that are not intended to be permanent. Authoral ideas, thoughts and reflections.

Niklas says that the productivity of a knowledge worker is directly related to the amount of permanent notes that he produces per day.

Each note must represent a single idea. As they represent building blocks of knowledge.

Interesting enough, this isn't a top down knowledge method, which divides knowledge in categories, but it's the opposite, it starts from the ideas and then it leaves to the links between notes to create the organization. It's the greatest multidisciplinary method of knowledge building.

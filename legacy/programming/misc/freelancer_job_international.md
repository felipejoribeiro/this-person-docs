# How can one work for international companies?
The first thing we must do is a glossary with important terms:
- Remessa internacional: Money from o to the international organizations.
- Câmbio: The difference of value between both the fiat money used in the transaction.
- Spread: Difference between the price paid and the fiat money price in the moment of the transaction. (normally is higher)
- IOF: Financial operation bill. The quota is $0.38\%$ for different persons, and $1.1\%$ for same person transactions. This bill normally is embedded in the spread value but if the sold object was service  than maybe you don't need to pay this bill.
- Contrato de Câmbio: Whenever a transaction is made, the bank must create a contract specifying from whom the money came. But it can be simplified and made cheaper.

# Physical persona with bank
The first way of receiving the money is as a physical person with your bank. So you pass the bank account and the foreign person deposit the money. So you must ask your bank for an international bank account number (IBAN). And the bank has a international code (swift) so you must ask this IBAN and swift  and with that the person can send you the money (wire transfer). Then the money get to the bank and he send you in your current after all the proceedings required. The good side for this is that the money comes for your account without the need for intermediary people or organizations. But this is very expensive, with Brasil bank, itau and santander and this came with a spread of 20 cents when the dollar was $2.50$, so kind of $10\%$. Very expensive and really slow (1 week normally). And the "Remessa" must be $3000$ dollars total for cambial contract (you must go to your bank to sign the bloody contract), and if the value is bigger than that, you must bring a ton of documents specified by the federal reserve (this varies from bank to bank). A very bureaucratic process.
What you must understand is that, when you receive dollars from other countries, and bring the money for your Brazilian account (obligatory because legislation), what you are doing is selling dollars for the bank, and the bank can charge you in the worse way possible when you do this operation with then. So this method is not recommended. 
Besides that there is the cambial contract that is expensive as well. And besides all that there is the income tax that must be paid once a mouth and the quota is $27\%$.
So receiving as a physical person from the bank is too expensive and inviable. Not recommended.

# Physical persona with with transferwise (https://wise.com/br)
Is a service that enables a person to do international transactions without too much bureaucracy. But there are some limitations.
The first good side is the lack of bureaucracy. You can make your account and you can register your bank account and then just wait for the money to check in. Other good think is that the spread is very slow. The IOF comes already in the spread. Very simple.
The bad side is that it can be slow (3 days). You don't need a cambial contract as you are receiving the money in your fiat currency and the institution making the bureaucracy is the Brazilian bank being the transferwise intermediary. So all you need to do to turn the money legal is to declare it annually in the income tax. So the registration of this income must be made very seriously as any error may result in big taxes and fines.
Other bad side of this method is that it is very expensive as well. You will have to declare the income and pay heavy taxes. Other limitation is the maximum transfer that is allowed, that is 3000 dollars, or 10000 reais for the month, something like that. 
For some one that don't have a company and is starting with freelance or job this is a good solution.

# Physical persona with Paypal
This is a good options as there isn't any bureaucracy. The international agent will make the transaction and the money will check in your paypal account. And then you can convert there to reais and bring to your bank account without complications. The problem is that this alternative is very expensive. The quota is $6\%$ for cambiam tax that is a very big amount of money. And besides that you must declare it to the federal reserve as well, so this is a fiscal passive too. Can be slow too (3 days).

# Juridic person with the bank
The worse option. But the bright sides are that you will have a good support from the bank. Probably you will not pay IOF if what you are selling is services. But, there isn't income taxes, what is awesome. The first problem is that this is slow. Most times this take days. And it is a bureaucratic process with 3000 dollars limit and you will have to sign the contract once a month. And this is a very expensive process. The same thing with physical person.

# Juridic person with a foreign exchange broker
You will contract a organization that will receive the money in your name, and you can negotiate with then the operations fees. The man in the video says this is the best option. For the bright side, the attendance is personalized. Can be via whatsapp or other means. You don't need to pay the IOF as the agency knows how to create the cambial contract very well and will take care of these things for you. Not even ISS depending of some proceedings. The spread is really low. Like $1\%$ to $2\%$, the slowest. Take care with $100\%$ digital exchange brokers, as they ask for bigger spreads. Other good thing is that you will not pay income tax as the money will arrive in your juridic person's account, with a fiscal note with the exact value that entered your account and is totally legal.
A good thing is to have good accounting when thinking about the best practices for the juridic persons fiscal endeavors from a tax point of view. You can receive the money in the broker account and leave the money there to speculate with the dollar a little and receive the money whenever you want, this is good for organizing payment dates that are better for you company tax policies.
There isn't value limits. You can receive how much money you want. So the bureaucracy is very low.
What the bad side. Is kind of slow, depending the bank of the client it can take days. It can be a little expensive as the cambial contract still necessary. You don't have to deal with the bureaucracy of the contract but you will pay for him (this varies a little can be between 100 and 300 reais per contract (remessa)).
This method can be done with MEI. But you must talk to good accounting for better international invoice issuance (nota fiscal). He will instruct you in how to avoid some taxes like ISS. Good accounting is as important as good advocacy.
It's very important to adjust the contract of services with your client so that it is made with your company and not with you.
The payment method must be *wired transfer* that is the international TED. The exchange broker will give you your IBAN and swift as previous stated and you give these addresses for your client and the payment will be made.
The value of the dollar is important, so keep looking the value.

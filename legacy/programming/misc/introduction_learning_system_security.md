# Learning principles of information security
You don't need to learn all programming languages to know how to deal with programming. This is due to the fact that all programming languages obey to three fundamental principles:

- The principle of abstraction;
- The principle of correspondence;
- The principle of Data type completeness.

As described by `R. D. Tennet`. Then, when you are able to understand that every programming language is a implementation of these needs, you can adapt your workflow to any syntax or paradigm. There will be a plenty of times when you will be lost and will not know what to do. But that is fine. Part of the job is the constant discovery and research. And with each problem you will be better at discovering solutions. So the most important thing isn't to know, but to know how to discover.

The field is very vast, so there are two approaches. You can chose one field and become an expert or you can become a generalist. But in both cases you must understand how to engage new things, as they always keep comming aside your professional inclinations.

A common question is "When is a penetration tester good enough?"

The first thing we must understand is how to thing outside the box. A good way of exercising non standard thinking is by always focusing on the limitations of the problem. That is, instead of thinking on what you can do, you must first list all the things you can't do and truly imagine ways of always broad your channel of possibilities.

A tendency when dealing with a problem is to repeat the practices that you observed around you throughout your life. Thinking outside the box means to being able to look through this noise. And really test all limitations and obstacles imposed on us by our natural bias. A good phrase is:

"A problem is an emotional state. Without emotions, it is just a situation."

Confusion and frustration are what define that there is a problem. Without those, you are just working and learning, as always. There is nothing to fear, what must be done will eventually be done and what must occur will eventually occur.

Other thing that is very important, is that you must know your goal. When you don't have a clear goal, you will stop on the first obstacle, that can take the form of another problem vaguely associated with what you are doing, but you end up investing several hours on this side topic and completely forgeting what you was doing in the first place. Estipulate a clear goal is essential. Goals are what keep us moving, find one for your self in everything you do.

The information security field is vast. You must know very well what you know and what you do not know. Then you have to adapt the amount of information to our strengths and weaknesses.

There are two rules that are important, he first is the `Pareto` principle that states that, you must invest `20%` of the effort to learn `80%` of something, but you must invest `80%` of your effort if you want to learn the other `20%`. So you can focus in increasing your skills fast in the beginning and develop proficiency with time. This is good as it enables the new commer to engage with development farely fast.

Other principle that is very important is the `Learning Pyramid`.

## The Learning Pyramid
This pyramid tries to describe how learning can be done in so different ways and how each one impacts the learning process:


| Retention rate | Learning activity before test of knowledge
| -              | -
| 90%            | `Teach` someone else/use immediately.
| 75%            | `Practice` what one learned.
| 50%            | Engaged in a `group discussion`.
| 30%            | `Watch` a demonstration.
| 20%            | `Watch` audiovisual.
| 10%            | `Reading`.
| 5%             | `Listening` to a lecture.


But latter research found that this varies from individual to individual. So this low must be adjusted to each particular individual.

Passive learning is just worst than the active learning. It is easier, so you can do it for more time, but it is inefficient too when compared to active learning.

Not all information is healthy. There are matterials that only will make you confussed, so be careful with the quality of the information besides the volume.

## Documentation
When creating documentation you must first consider the target audience. The objective of a documentation is to present the information acquired in a easy to reproduce way and easy to understand.

So you must consider using programs like `FlameShot` that gives the developer a easy way of taking pictures of the screen and create anotations on it. And `CherryTree`

## Organization
Imagine you are up in a mountain. There is a fourest around it and you see another mountain on the horizon. You must prepare yourself, checking references like rivers and other features to guide yourself down there. Remember, you will not be able to se the mountain you want to go from the forest, so you must prepare yourself with easy to follow steps by looking the trajectory you must perform from the initial mountain. That is the importance of overviews. Prepare in advance and and organize yourself.

An inexperienced woodcutter takes 30 minutes to sharpen his axe and 3 hours to cut down the tree.
The experienced one will sharpen the axe for 3 hours and cut down the tree within 30 minutes.

There are techniques we can use, like:
- Scrum;
- Agile;
- ToDo-Lists;
- Bullet Journal, and more.

## Comfort
Comfort is an emotional state of a person's mind. It has a strong effect over behavior, thinking, focus, attention and the ability to concentrate.
There is the `Yerkes-Dodson` law. It describes the cognitive performance as a function of the level of stress/nervousness. This curve is divided in four sections and is very particular as well for each individual:

```
     |
     |        Healthy                       Sick
     |                    _.---------._
   P |                  .`      |      `.
   E |                .` Focused| Fatigue`.
   R |              .`          |          `.
   F |            .` | Motivated|          | `.
   O |          .`   |          |   Exhaustion `.
   R |        .`     |          |          |     `.
   M |       /   Healthy        |          |Panic  \
   A | Lame /    Tension        |         Anxiety   \
   N |     /         |          |          | Anger   \ Disease
   C |    /          |          |          |          \
   E |   / Inactive  | Optimum  | Excessive|  Burnout  \
     |  /  and Bored |  Stress  | Stress   |  Breakdown \
     | /             |          |          |             \
    _|______________________________________________________
     |                  Stress Levels

```

So too much and too little stress are bad for performance. There is a sweet spot we must seek. To find this sweet spot you mus experiment as this curve varies depending on the person and the activity. If the demands of the job leave you in a bad spot, talk to your supervisor and get some help.

```
| Zone          | simptoms
| -             | -
| Comfort zone  | Feels safe and in control
| Fear zone     | Lack self-confidence, find excuses, be affected by others opinions
| Learning zone | Deal with challenges and problems, Acquire new skills, extend your comfort zone
| Growth zone   | Find purpose and live dreams, set new goals, conquer objectives
```
Now we should understand the progression between decisions to step out of our comfort zone or stay in it. We will often get into situations where we do not know what to do. These will come again and again. However, we will always learn something new, and it will become more comfortable each time.

## Handling frustration
There are two kinds of frustration, one caused by external influences, such as negative opinions of superiors, and the other is caused by inner frustrations, caused by conscious or subconscious thought processes.

One thing that helps is try to review the thought process in the third person. Some feelings are difficult to admit, but you must find ways of thinking about then and analise then. Rationalization is key. Everyone has an individual frustration tolerance. People that has this limit too low tend to give up or break off quickly when unexpected resistance arises. Or the success does not occur within a specific time. The result is a behavior of increased tendency to stress and agressive avoidance.

The frustration tolerance can be trained and developed very well. You may have a friend who might have been in a stressful situation but is able to keep it cool despite that. Lets see from where this feeling comes from.

There are several steps for a successful endeavor. They are:

```
        vision   -->  Skills  -->  Incentives  -->  Resources  -->  Action Plan

          |              |             |                 |               |
       absence        absence       absence          absence          absence
          |              |             |                 |               |
          V              V             V                 V               V
       Confusion      Anxiety    Gradual change      Frustration    False starts

```

So, the cause of frustration is the absence of resources. In the context of information security and programming this usually takes form of lack of some wisdon or information that is required to solve some problem. So, more one time, we see the importance of learning to finde useful information.

To train the frustration tolerance you must place yourself in a stressful situation but in a conscious way. Then we can analise our behavior and take notes on our reactions.

The most important thing is to understand that the feeling of frustration is temporary. This means that thing will get normal again.

## Progress
To being able to see progress you need two things, `reference` and `time`, if both are measurable you will be able to see your progress. If you can't find reference, find others who can, but they will need to take the road with you so that they can see you change with time.

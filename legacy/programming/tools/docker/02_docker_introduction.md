# Docker introduction
The docker program has a free edition and an enterprise edition. The `Docker` program has some versions, the `Edge` that has a new release every month, the `stable` version comes once a quarter and it's supported for four months. With the enterprise edition, the support goes for ever with any version you chose.


# First steps
As first container you can run the command `sudo docker run hello-world`. And the image will be downloaded from the Docker Hub, a new container will be created ro run the image. The output will be streamed to the current terminal. And that is it! you will have run your first container.You can check all the images locally installed with the `sudo docker images` command. You can see what is running with the `sudo docker ps` command and if you want to see all containers that are running and that have runned you can issue the `sudo docker ps -a` command. To stop a running container you can run the `sudo docker stop <ID>` command, where the `ID` is the container ID.
